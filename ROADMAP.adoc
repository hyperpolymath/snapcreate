== Awaiting Specification

The following require project specification before implementation:

=== Core Project Definition

* [ ] Project purpose and scope
* [ ] Target use cases
* [ ] Feature requirements
* [ ] Architecture decisions (ADRs)

=== Build System

* [ ] guix.scm or flake.nix
* [ ] deno.json (if using ReScript/JS)
* [ ] Cargo.toml (if using Rust)
* [ ] Custom justfile recipes for the project

=== Source Code

* [ ] src/ directory structure
* [ ] Core modules
* [ ] Tests
* [ ] Examples

=== RSR Compliance

* [ ] .well-known/security.txt
* [ ] .well-known/ai.txt
* [ ] .well-known/humans.txt
* [ ] RSR_COMPLIANCE.adoc
* [ ] STATE.scm (Guile Scheme state file)

== Future Phases

[NOTE]
====
The phases below are placeholders. Actual roadmap milestones will be defined once the project specification is uploaded.
